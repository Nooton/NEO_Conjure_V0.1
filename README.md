# NEO_Conjure_V0.1
Beta version of conjure mode enable OSM chip

Authors: Fraser Fulton and Devon Redekopp

This is the beta version of our conjure mode enabled chip. Please report any bugs found so we can fix them for the full release 
on NeoV2 when it comes out. Ensure you turn off the visual navigation with this beta version as it will not work otherwise. 
Hopefully with the full release we will have made both our code and the original code cleaner so that we do not need the extra 
space.

Once you have our code on your chip you can go into and out of conjure mode with the following steps.

1. Go to the bundle and mode that you want to be set up for conjure.
2. Press and hold the button for the green flash to enter conjure mode
3. Repeat step 2 to leave conjure mode

You can mode reset, factory reset, and use on chip programming while in conjure mode. Your flahses for holding the button are 
now green(conjure), yellow(program) and red/blue(reset). Timing is somewhat long for these in this version.

Lastly if you want to copy our code into your program or just want to see what we did please refer to the changelog. Although I 
recommend just moving your own modes, sandboxes and colors into our code.

ENJOY!
