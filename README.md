This is the beta version of our conjure mode enabled chip. Please report any bugs found so we can fix them for the full release on NEO v2 when it becomes available. Ensure you turn off the visual navigation with this beta version as it will not work otherwise.

Once you have our code on your chip you can go into and out of conjure mode with the following steps.

1. Go to the bundle and mode that you want to be set up for conjure.
2. Press and hold the button for the green flash to enter conjure mode
3. Repeat step 2 to leave conjure mode

You can mode reset, factory reset, and use on chip programming while in conjure mode. Your flahses when holding the button are now green (conjure), then yellow (program), then red/blue (reset).

Lastly if you want to copy our code into your program or just want to see what we did please refer to the changelog. Although I recommend just moving your own modes, sandboxes and colors into our code.

ENJOY!
